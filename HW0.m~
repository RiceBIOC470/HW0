% HW0: some simple excerises to get started with MATLAB. Please complete by
% the second class. Answer questions in comments and return assignment via
% github
%% numbers vs strings
%Run the following two sections. explain why one gives a sensible result and the other doesn't
% extra credit: can you explain the value of the variable b? 
x = 1; 
y = x + x
%%
a = '1';
b = a+a
%% concatenation
% what is being done by the following statements? what is the difference between x2 and a2? 
% what is the difference between x2 and x2b (hint run the size command on
% these arrays and explain the results). 

x2 = [x x]

a2 = [a a]

x2b = [x; x]

%% = vs ==, isequal
% explain why the identical commands with the == commands give different answers 
% hint: check the values of a and b as you execute the following statements
% if necessary. 
a = 1; b =2; 

a == b
a = b;
a == b



%explain why the following gives an error:
x2b == x2

%explain the result of this nearly equivalent operation
isequal(x2b,x2)

%change these two lines by adding a single character to each such that the
%they both evaluate to true and neither gives an error:

%explain why the following gives an error:
x2b == x2

%explain the result of this nearly equivalent operation
isequal(x2b,x2)



%%  : operator 
%(hint for the following type "help colon" at the command line to see
% how the ":" operator works
% the following makes an array of the numbers from one to ten: 
oneToTen = 1:10;

%here are two ways to make the array of numbers from 1 to twenty
%explain how the second line works.
1:20
[oneToTen, oneToTen+10]
% do each of the following in two different ways, by manipulating the array
% oneToTen and by defining it concisely from scratch

% 1. even numbers from two to twenty

% 2. odd numbers from one to nineteen

% 3. Even numbers in reverse order from twenty to two (hint lookup the
% matlab function fliplr)

% explain why the fliplr funciton no longer works and find a different
% matlab function that performs an equivalent function on the same array
oneToTen = oneToTen';
fliplr(oneToTen)

%% matrices, . operator

%look at the matrix this defines. Note the other functions zeros, eye, and
%rand which can define matrices. 

m1 = ones(2);
m2 = 2*ones(2);

%explain the output of these two commands:
m1*m2
m1.*m2

%explain this command:
m2./m1
%extra credit: explain why this command gives a warning:
m2/m1

%% access particular elements

%define a random matrix

rand_nums = rand(5);

%explain what is being done in each of the following lines
